### ST Table view

This is a recrutiment project that required coding a view page. I decided to use create-react-app, typescript and scss. For state management I'm using React Context

### To run the project you need to:

1. Clone the project

2. `npm install`

3. `npm start`

4. Open `localhost:3000`

### Improvements:

1. For this project I used implemented the view, table filtering, mocked server response

2. Future improvements:

   a) Not every component is fully working, for example: sorting, pagination, user icon on top, sidebar navigation.

   b) Sidebar navigation: I'd implement react router with outlets to change content in page.

   c) File structure: I could move some components to a component librabry/design system directory.

   d) If any functionality would be passed to components (button, input etc) I'd wrap them in useCallback/useMemo to keep them performant.

3. Tests
4. Linting files on pre-commit.

#### Enjoy and happy new year ðŸŽ‰
